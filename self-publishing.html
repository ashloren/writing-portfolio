		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://#/feelings-copyright/" rel="bookmark">My Feelings on Copyright &#038; Intellectual Property</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I consider myself a creative individual, but my feelings on copyright and intellectual property are somewhat complex and I&#8217;ll admit that, if anything, I lean toward a worldview of equal accessibility to all forms of media.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.copyright.gov/"></a></p>
<p>By &#8220;media,&#8221; I mean everything from films and books to artwork and music.</p>
<p>I suppose it&#8217;s important to disclose that I value respect more than money.</p>
<p>I feel that equal access to the creative works produced by mankind is ultimately a benefit to all, as a collective whole.</p>
<p>Increased access leads to increases in reactions, feedback, conversations, inspiration, derivative works, ideas and personal enrichment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14.pdf"></a></p>
<p>To me, these combined benefits usually outweigh the importance of one or a few people becoming rich by restricting access to their creations.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am certainly <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOT</strong></span> saying that artists, musicians, authors and actors shouldn&#8217;t be compensated for their creative contributions.</p>
<h2>A Hypothetically Starving Artist</h2>
<p>For example, if a painter creates an original piece of artwork then they have every right to sell that painting to another person if they so choose.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong> &#8211; the implications of this are pretty obvious.</p>
<p>In the case of selling it to someone who wants to hang it on their wall, the two people negotiate a price and the deal is done.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t get paid again for that painting because it has already been sold to a new owner.</p>
<p>Since it was a new and original work, the sold painting is the only one that exists at this point.</p>
<p>But since our artist was starving (not stupid), let&#8217;s assume that he took some photos of the painting before selling it and posted them online for others to see.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it becomes a very real possibility that the buyer may be the last and only other human being who <em>ever sees</em> the painting at all.</p>
<p>Maybe it hangs on the new owner&#8217;s wall for the next few decades before both are completely destroyed in some natural disaster.</p>
<p>Had the artist not taken photos of it, the art would then be lost forever.</p>
<p>And I think we can all agree on what a shame that would be!</p>
<p>I tend to think this is <strong>ALSO</strong> fine for the buyer to do as well.</p>
<p>After all, he loved the painting so much that he bought it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think that any two people who create and appreciate these things enough to have made any such transaction would also be the kind who want to share its beauty with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So I see absolutely nothing wrong with the buyer taking some photos of his new painting and posting them online for others to see.</p>
<p>Now that we know what I am okay with, let&#8217;s make it clear what I find unacceptable.</p>
<h2>Stealing Something You Paid For</h2>
<p>It would <strong>NOT</strong> be okay (in my mind) for the buyer to take photos of his new painting and then claim to have created it himself.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances would that be okay with me.</p>
<p><strong>THAT</strong> is theft, even though he paid the real artist. It doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Stealing it outright in the absence of permission or compensation would obviously be theft as well.</p>
<p>Both of those scenarios suck&#8230;but assuming our artist had still taken photos, then the second crook is guilty of the lesser crime.</p>
<p>At least as far as I&#8217;m concerned.</p>
<p>In the first scenario, the artist is paid with money and then robbed of credit and denied respect.</p>
<p>I can only speak for myself, but credit and respect are way more important to me than cash ever has been.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s acceptable for the new owner to take photos of the painting and then sell them to other people.</p>
<p>If he wants to charge money, I believe he should have to sell the actual painting to someone else.</p>
<p>The artist, however, wouldn&#8217;t be doing anything wrong by charging others for copies or reproductions of the work if he wanted to.</p>
<p>You see, I have much less of a problem with people selling their creative work than I do with <em>denying others access</em> to them in the <em>absence of money</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fine with people getting paid for the things they create.</p>
<p>But if we lived in world where artists were paid for their work, it would be much harder to explain why they are so often starving.</p>
<h2>Cool Story, Bro</h2>
<p>In reality, most of us need some kind of day job or supplementary career to live comfortably.</p>
<p>And you know what? There is nothing at all wrong with that.</p>
<p>Bits and pieces of my own original work have been included in the work of others, sometimes after asking for permission and others under the assumption of fair use.</p>
<p>Do I get upset if I&#8217;m not asked first? No.</p>
<p>Would I be upset if I wasn&#8217;t credited? Mildly.</p>
<p><a href="http://#/wp-content/uploads/Happiness-A-to-Z-The-Gleeful-Guide-to-Finding-and-Following-Your-Bliss-Louise-Baxter-Harmon-June-Cotner-9781632280077-Amazon.com-Books.png"></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Real life example:</strong></span> a quick Amazon search turned up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1632280078">this book</a>, which is very ironically a collection of quotes centered around the topic of happiness (you know, me being the cheery, optimistic type and all).</p>
<p>Now I know what Tom Hanks and I have in common.</p>
<p>While a lot of people will probably guess things like how much money we make or the number of awards we have won, it is actually neither.</p>
<p>(He is also not as sarcastic as I am).</p>
<p>It turns out, the only thing we have in common is that we are both quoted on page 116 of this book.</p>
<h2>Pirates Are Cool Too!</h2>
<p>Most people will probably think it&#8217;s kind of ass backwards for me to be as enthusiastic about a concept like <em>Kickstarter</em> as I am about <em>The Pirate Bay</em>.</p>
<p>But I totally am.</p>
<p>Being the broke asshole I&#8217;ve kind of always been, I frequently download torrents if there is a film I would like to watch or a software I could find a lot of use for.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t lose any sleep over this because at the end of the day, I simply do not have the money to pay for these things even if I wanted to.</p>
<p>Now, you should probably take everything I say with a grain of salt since we have clearly established that I do <strong>NOT</strong> get paid a Tom Hanks salary.</p>
<p>You may think <strong>THAT</strong> is the real reason I feel the way I do about this stuff.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;re right.</p>
<p>I may feel differently if I was as rich as Tom Hanks, and then suddenly encountered some financial threat to a level of wealth I had grown accustomed to.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m pretty sure after nearly 29 years of living the way I have, it would just seem like returning from a bizarre vacation or waking up from a dream.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m weird.</p>
<p><a href="http://#/wp-content/uploads/211bbfb8b38cafc136bceebf9081012e.jpg"></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The moral of the story is this:</strong></span> if you have the money and can afford to buy one of my books, that&#8217;s fantastic. I appreciate every dollar.</p>
<p>And if you can&#8217;t afford it or don&#8217;t have the money but still would like to read something I&#8217;ve written, just email me and ask for it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Students have a great deal of writing assignments in college. Thesis statements, persuasive essays, argumentative essays and research papers are only a handful of the types of papers you will write at school.</p>
<p>With all this writing, you will most likely want to check out a professional essay service like CustomWritings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.customwritings.com">Custom Writings hires freelance essay writers</a> for this main purpose. They will be able to write your papers and have them to you before they are due. However, there are different types of writing services out there. Below are some tips you can follow to choose the right essay writing service.</p>
<h2>Avoid Cheap Deals</h2>
<p>Saving money is something that students try to do. But, the obvious thing is that if students are looking for quality custom papers, they can&#8217;t expect to get them cheap. Visiting academic writing agencies comparison sites will help you determine the average market prices as well as the variety of services you have available to you. Although you don&#8217;t want to go with a service that has overpriced offers, it&#8217;s suggested that you do go with one that charges average prices.</p>
<h2>Look at the Company&#8217;s Online Ratings</h2>
<p>Prior to putting in any orders, you should seek out comments and ratings that other students left about the company. Positive comments are a good indication that the company is reliable and offers quality services. However, if you find comments about the company being late on delivering or plagiarizing, you might want to search out another company.</p>
<h2>Reliability and Time</h2>
<p>Although you probably won&#8217;t have any problems with the company being meticulous with revisions or time management, you should still be clear on some things such as if the writer will be able to handle your precise directions and if you have any customization requests. You want your paper to be believable, reliable and to-be-emulated essay.</p>
<h2>View their Samples</h2>
<p>Check through all their samples on various topics and subjects. You will want to be able to see if their style of writing will fit you or not. Also, you should talk with the company to decide if the writer will be versed enough in your specific topic and if they have already handled work that is similar to what you are looking for.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you want to have a vision of how you want your finished essay to look like. If your vision is an outstanding essay, make that clear with the writer. If you have no idea what type of finished essay you need, you can also talk with the writer about that since they will be experienced in essay writing and will know what professors are looking for and what will provide you with the best mark.</p>
<p>Investing in professional essay writing services is not just investing in your future, but your overall academic success. Therefore, it should be your main goal to find a quality writing service that has your overall goals and success in mind.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://#/the-easiest-way-to-write-a-book/" rel="bookmark">The Easiest Way to Write a Book</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://#/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/E6B6AEACD4A8BBB878A1E9BBD228D.jpg"></a>I don&#8217;t care if you are the author of several published books or just a savvy entrepreneur looking for an extra source of passive income &#8212; in either case, you have (however guiltily) wondered at some point, &#8220;what is the easiest way to write a book?&#8221;</p>
<p>Admit it. Don&#8217;t let it make you feel dirty, no one is any better than anyone else who has shared that same thought.</p>
<p>You might think it feels like some form of cheating. At least it tricks you into feeling shame because you assume that what you are asking for is a shortcut to writing a fantastic book that no one can put down until they have made the captivating journey from cover to cover.</p>
<p>But ask the jury for a verdict on this one instead of jumping to conclusions. Are you really asking for a shortcut or are you asking an honest question about the most efficient method of writing a book?</p>
<h2>Stop Worrying About Writing a Book</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t care what preconceived notions you have come to this post with as far as gaining prestige as an author, landing a big publishing deal or becoming the next Shakespeare. The fact of the matter is that you should really stop concerning yourself with writing a book because anyone can write a book that totally sucks. There is nothing special about that.</p>
<p>What you should actually be trying to figure out is how to tell your story. The one that is every bit as unique to you as your fingerprints.</p>
<p>This is the truly amazing feat because you are literally the only person capable of doing that. Only you know all the parts to your story and only you can pass it on for others to hear if you choose to.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to skin a cat, while we&#8217;re on that topic. A book is only one of many forms that a story can take. Stories are told through more mediums than I can list here.</p>
<p>They can be spoken out loud or told to live listeners. They can be acted out on a stage or add the missing lyrics to an otherwise perfect song.</p>
<p>Your whole life and the story of your journey is the landscape picture on the front of the box of a 1,000 piece puzzle. The pieces are each a small sticky note that ends in mid-sentence. You simply need to figure out where each one starts and ends.</p>
<h2>The Easiest Way to Write a Book</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s the answer the question. What is the easiest way to write a book? Not just for you or me but for anyone, regardless of skill or experience or talent?</p>
<p>The easiest way to write a book is to not write one at all. The second easiest way is to fill a few pages, put your name on it and not care at all about the words on those pages.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t feel better by doing either of these things. If you do, this blog isn&#8217;t for you.</p>
<p>The next easiest way to write a book?</p>
<p>Is to not think, not put off, not be afraid, not critique, not make excuses for, not settle, not imitate and to just simply write it. Your story. Exactly the way you think the thoughts with no filter and no regard for whether another soul will even be able to decipher a word of it.</p>
<p>Only when you write it all out the way it exists in your mind will you have the raw material needed for what will later become a book.</p>
<p>This is the part that you want to believe is easier than it seems. The part that feels like the hard work.</p>
<h2>The Write Way is the Only Way</h2>
<p>Honestly, it is the  hard work. But it&#8217;s also incredibly easy if you follow the instructions on the bottle.</p>
<p>Write the book and do nothing at all while you are writing it. Don&#8217;t interrupt yourself, not even once.</p>
<p>The words you use are tempered into the story that can later be sent out into the world in the form of a book, almost as an insignificant afterthought.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even have to do that part at all if you don&#8217;t care to. Have someone else do the parts you have no desire for. Worry about it all once you hold the same story in your hands that you carry in your heart. Live your life, tell your story. It can all become a book later.</p>

<p>Okay, so what the hell is Optimize Press, you ask?</p>
<p>For those of you that do not know, it was a WordPress theme that was designed with internet marketers in mind. Meaning, the  pages were styled to resemble landing pages and websites more so than the traditional blog style of a WordPress site.</p>
<p><a href="https://zf137.infusionsoft.com/go/op/ashloren/">Optimize Press 2.0</a>, as you probably could have guessed, is the newest release and it&#8217;s a whole different beast.</p>
<p>Since I had the first version already, I got an email about the launch at the end of last month and figured I&#8217;d sign up as an affiliate during the pre-launch. Afterwards, I did a quick Google search for Optimize Press 2.0 review and was slightly horrified by the hordes of affiliates who were already pushing the product on the internet populace with what I&#8217;m sure was strictly fair and truthful recommendations based only on their experience with said product.</p>
<p>Sarcasm is sometimes hard to pick up on when reading, so I&#8217;ll just admit to it right now.</p>
<p>At any rate, I figured that I&#8217;d join the army of these affiliates and write my own review after I&#8217;d had a chance to try it out myself. Why not, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there is certainly no way my review will find its way to the first page of Google and therefore it&#8217;s highly unlikely that I&#8217;ll even make a single sale as a result of writing this. Luckily for the internet peoples, that isn&#8217;t my main motivation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more in this blogging bull shit to help others and share my own experiences than I am out to earn a commission off of every visitor to my site. That being said, let&#8217;s dive into my thoughts on Optimize Press 2.0 since I purchased it and began using it several days ago now.</p>
<h2>What Can Optimize Press Actually Do?</h2>
<p>Okay, so if you already have a site that uses WordPress, then you are already familiar with themes most likely. For those who don&#8217;t currently use WordPress, a theme is essentially like a skin or template that changes the visual appearance of your site.</p>
<p>As you may already know, WordPress also has something called plugins. These like extensions and they add different types of functionality to WordPress when added to your site.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to add social sharing buttons to your blog posts and you would have no problem finding an appropriate plugin to accomplish this, as there are enough to cause a nice case of decision paralysis.</p>
<p>Back to the point &#8212; the first version of Optimize Press allowed you to create pages using a number of different page templates that were included. There were different styles for landing pages and sales pages, mostly. It also had lots of customization options too.</p>
<p>They added fields to the page editor which made it easy to copy and paste your autoresponder codes and you could add marketing style headlines and all that jazz.</p>
<h2>Optimize Press 2.0 New Features</h2>
<p>Okay, so when the creators of Optimize Press said that 2.0 was a completely new product built from the ground up, they weren&#8217;t kidding.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the cooler additions in terms of capabilities, at least in my opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 16px;">Comes with a membership plugin that makes it easy to setup membership-style sites with recurring payments via Paypal or your choice of several other payment processors</span></li>
<li>Features a live page editor that allows you to insert content modules and see the changes on the screen immediately</li>
<li>Significantly more control over page layout and design of elements</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are some of the major ones I&#8217;ve noticed. There are also new templates which look pretty slick, and they apparently have a monthly membership that is optional if you want to receive new styles and templates on a monthly basis. I skipped that part, as I wasn&#8217;t interested. I simply paid the $97 for the core package.</p>
<h2>Who Should Buy Optimize Press 2.0?</h2>
<p>This is an important point, which is why I gave it a whole section here. <a href="https://zf137.infusionsoft.com/go/op/ashloren/">Optimize Press 2.0</a> is not a worthwhile purchase for EVERYONE who simply has a site or blog. It&#8217;s really not all that useful if you are strictly a blogger.</p>
<p>I setup a couple new pages on this website using Optimize Press 2.0, but just for an squeeze page with an opt-in form.</p>
<p>I mostly bought it to use on my other sites, which are quite a bit different in terms of my goals.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Optimize Press 2.0 is for website owners who are trying to make money with their website. It&#8217;s not well suited for hobby sites or personal blogs. This product is for people marketing products or services in order to make a profit.</p>
<h2>My OptimizePress 2.0 Review</h2>
<p>I remember when I bought the first version, I wanted to use the theme on certain pages of this website but wanted the rest of my site to continue using the same theme I already had at that time.</p>
<p>Well, since you can&#8217;t have two themes in use on the same blog at the same time, that wasn&#8217;t possible.</p>
<p>Some people suggested I simply install the theme on a sub directory of my site, which I did end up trying. But that wasn&#8217;t really what I wanted to do, or how I wanted to do it.</p>
<p>So that was pretty frustrating.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is no longer an issue with <a href="https://zf137.infusionsoft.com/go/op/ashloren/">Optimize Press 2.0</a>. Why? Because in the new version, it&#8217;s available as both a theme <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>AND</strong></span> a plugin, which achieves the same or similar effect.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s probably one of my favorite changes in the new version. If you don&#8217;t want to change the look and feel of your entire website, you can just keep using your current theme and then setup pages with Optimize Press styles and templates by installing the plugin instead.</p>
<p><strong>Best of both worlds!</strong></p>
<p>I also really like how you have more control over the layout of pages. Among my favorite content modules are the very underrated additions such as Vertical Spacing (this really does make your pages look better) which is essentially just adding spacer images between the elements on your page. Small tweak, big difference.</p>
<h2>What I Didn&#8217;t Like About Optimize Press 2.0</h2>
<p>Okay, I&#8217;d like to first make it clear that I tend to be incredibly stubborn when it comes to things like reading instructions or, God forbid, watching a goddamn video tutorial that would probably make my life so much simpler. Screw all of that!</p>
<p>I have a strong preference for simply digging in, getting my hands dirty and figuring it out on my own and as I experiment.</p>
<p>What this results in is tons of time spent making mistakes that I could probably easily avoid if I sat through a five minute video. But since that sounds like a fate worse than death, I avoid it at all costs.</p>
<p>So taking that into consideration, one of the things I didn&#8217;t like so much about Optimize Press 2.0 was the learning curve. It really isn&#8217;t anything like its predecessor and I had to literally start all over in terms of learning how to use it.</p>
<p>Now, there are plenty of instructions and tutorials on their website. So the help is there, should you have enough sense to simply use it. This is more of a shortcoming on my end than a fault with the product.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, the new Optimize Press is more complicated and as such, can do significantly more than was possible in its first form.</p>
<p>I spent like an entire day playing around with it, making new pages and trying to learn how it all worked. It was kind of exhausting, to be honest. I still haven&#8217;t gotten it all sorted out, but I have made a good handful of pages so far, which you can check out here if you&#8217;d like to get an idea of what they look like:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 16px;">A simple <a href="http://www.bookbrained.com">opt-in page</a> for my email course</span></li>
<li>Landing page for <a href="http://#/ashly-lorenzana-the-blog/">free eBook</a> with opt-in form</li>
</ul>
<p>And here is a page I created inside my new membership site for Kindle authors.</p>
<p><a href="http://#/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bookbrained.com-author-promotion-101-.png"></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I think that looks pretty darn spiffy and since I am one of those weirdos who feels passionately about visuals and design, I basically dig that a lot.</p>
<h2>My Exclusive Bonus Offer</h2>
<p>Okay, so this is the part where I add a bonus for people who choose to buy this product through <a href="https://zf137.infusionsoft.com/go/op/ashloren/">my affiliate link</a>, which you can find sprinkled throughout this post as you may have noticed.</p>
<p>So what am I willing to throw in the deal to sweeten the pot for you?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p> So it was actually quite some time ago that the idea of turning my blog into an eBook first occurred to me. </span></p>
<p> But first, we should ask ourselves an important question&#8230;is turning a blog into a book even a good idea to begin with?</span></p>
<p> The answer will depend on who you ask, like most things. However, I do know that <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/why-buy-the-cow-27-popular-websites-that-became-bo,2535/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">several well known bloggers</span></a> have compiled anthologies of their best blog content and used it to publish a book or eBook.</span></p>
<p> Before we dive in to this though, I just wanted to make it clear that I do not have any illusions about my blog being turned into a book that makes me millions of dollars. I know that isn&#8217;t going to happen.</span></p>
<p> In fact, the blog makes me nothing at all in terms of money other than the affiliate links I endorse, which aren&#8217;t many. </span></p>
<p> So what was my motivation with this idea? To offer my best blog content in another format and in doing so, reach more people who may be more responsive to an eBook than they are to a blog. The way I look at it, all it really means is that there is one more way to be found.</span></p>
<p> And in the online world, being found is the most important thing. Period.</span></p>
<h2>What I Wanted to Do</h2>
<p> Okay, so&#8230;what did I want to do specifically to create this book from my blog?</span></p>
<p> First, I wanted to narrow it down to a single category. As you may have noticed, I post on several different topics and sort them according to which category they fit best in.</span></p>
<p><strong> My main categories are:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li> Self-Publishing</span></li>
<li> Freelance Writing</span></li>
<li> Making Money Online</span></li>
<li> Internet Marketing</span></li>
<li> Branding</span></li>
<li> Social Media</span></li>
</ol>
<p> It shouldn&#8217;t come as much of a surprise that categories one and two have a significant overlap. So do categories three and four, but I don&#8217;t focus on them as much as the first two.</span></p>
<p> I was most interested in turning my posts about self-publishing into an eBook. I blog about that more than the other topics and felt that I had the most value to offer within that group of posts.</span></p>
<p> Also important to take note of is that the appeal of the eBook will be tenfold if it centers around one topic, rather than several which is fine for the blog.</span></p>
<h2>Why I Didn&#8217;t Want to Do It Myself</h2>
<p> Some of my readers have probably already figured out that I&#8217;m a DIY type when it comes to getting things done online. </span></p>
<p> This can likely be attributed to my own roots &#8212; I started with nothing at all and used only free resources when I began to create my online platform. </span></p>
<p> I&#8217;m also just a huge fan of free tools and can rarely justify paying for something when there is a free alternative that gets the job done just as well, or nearly as well. I admire companies like Google because they create free tools that kick ass, or at least they once did. </span></p>
<p> So why then, you might ask, did I not simply opt to take on this project myself? </span></p>
<p> When I went to publish my first book in 2010, formatting was one of the aspects of self-publishing that I quickly came to wish I could just outsource to someone who knew what the hell they were doing. </span></p>
<p> It took me many long hours to get it just to the point where I felt it was acceptable for publishing. That&#8217;s to say, it still could have used some work once I called it good and published it. </span></p>
<p> Quite simply, I didn&#8217;t have the money for professional formatting at that time. </span></p>
<p> Of course, later on I would discover that my underused HTML skills were actually quite handy for Kindle formatting. Wish I had figured that one out earlier on. I was finally able to create an HTML template for Kindle books that you can download once you sign up for a <a href="http://#/publish"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">free membership</span></a> in my author&#8217;s training course.</span></p>
<p> But back to the story at hand. </span></p>
<p> First I had to figure out how the hell to get all the text from my blog posts out of WordPress, which wasn&#8217;t as easy as I had hoped it would be. The first place I went to look was the native &#8220;Import/Export&#8221; menu in WordPress itself.</span></p>
<p> However, this only creates an XML file for importing into another WordPress installation. That was disappointing. </span></p>
<p> So I headed over to Google to find out what my options were for exporting the text from my posts. Ideally, I wanted to export them as HTML in order to preserve the hyperlinks. Otherwise, I would have to go back and manually add all the links which would be a serious drag.</span></p>
<p> Sadly, I wasn&#8217;t able to find any good solution to achieve this. </span></p>
<p> While I did find a cool service that turns <a href="http://blog2print.sharedbook.com/blogworld/printmyblog/index.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">blogs into print books</span></a> you can order, it was only available for free blogging platforms like Blogger, Typepad and WordPress.com blogs, much to my dismay.</span></p>
<p> Next, I headed on over to the WordPress plugin directory and did a search for &#8220;export posts&#8221; to see if any developer had come up with a solution. Again, pretty grim results. </span></p>
<p> I finally found a plugin that would <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-pdf-export/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">export posts to a PDF</span></a>, but there were some major problems. There was no option to exclude images, which I wanted to do (more on that in a moment). The resulting PDF was far from what I had hoped and definitely what I had envisioned the book to be like.</span></p>
<p> Since this time around I had the funds, I decided this would be a task better handled by a group of people who were professionals and that&#8217;s where Vook comes in.</span></p>
<h2>Why I Chose to Work With Vook</h2>
<p><a href="http://#/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpg"></a> First, a little bit of background on them to serve as an introduction. <a href="http://www.vook.com">Vook</a> is a New York-based startup that specializes in book apps and interactive eBooks that feature several forms of multimedia, including videos. </span></p>
<p> I had first discovered their website quite some time ago, when searching for professional ebook conversion services. I thought that their services looked promising, but they had no prices listed on their website and instead asked you to fill out a form for a free quote.</span></p>
<p> That along with the fact that they were advertising in Google AdWords was enough to convince me that they were likely out of my budget at that time, which would have been true as it turns out. </span></p>
<p> Vook offers just about everything you could imagine for eBooks, from production and creation to cover design and an attractive distribution package that makes your books available on Amazon, B&amp;N and the iBookstore.</span></p>
<p> Okay, but seriously&#8230;other than the fact that they were offering just what I needed, do you want to know what one of the main reasons I chose to hire them was?</span></p>
<p> <a href="http://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gary Vaynerchuk</strong></span></a>. I&#8217;m so in love with Gary. </span></p>
<p> Any company who helps to create his books has to be awesome. It just makes perfect sense. </span></p>
<p> Vook&#8217;s version of his popular 2009 book &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://crushitbook.com/vook/"><em>Crush It</em></a>,</span>&#8221; includes a ton of video content that supplements the text and features exclusive interviews with the man himself. </span></p>
<p> If anyone reading this has never heard of Mr. Vaynerchuk, stop reading this right now and watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcqCAqZtedI"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">this keynote speech</span></a> he gave back in 2011. Now you&#8217;re in love with him too, right?</span></p>
<h2>My Thoughts on the Vook Experience</h2>
<p> So once I was decided on hiring Vook, I went ahead and filled out their quote form and attached the PDF I had created using the WordPress plugin as my manuscript. They sent a prompt reply and quoted me <strong>$350</strong> for the eBook file creation, which I agreed to. </span></p>
<p> Next, they sent over some paperwork and I happily signed the agreement, which was very detailed and outlined exactly what they would do and what I would end up owing them.</span></p>
<p> Next, I received an email informing me that my Vook client dashboard had been created and they provided me with my login details. </span></p>
<p> The dashboard is very clean and easy to use. It shows you the progress of your titles and has an &#8220;assets&#8221; button which is where you upload your documents and include any notes about the project that the staff may need along the way.</span></p>
<p> Speaking of the staff, I&#8217;d like to just say that they were incredibly professional, friendly and helpful throughout the process of creating my eBook files and cover design, which was an additional <strong>$199</strong> I opted to tack onto my order. The project was handled with a high level of efficiency and they went out of their way to ensure that everything was right with the files before I approved them earlier today.</span></p>
<p> Since I still don&#8217;t actually own an eReader device, I downloaded some (apparently) quirky desktop program to read the preview of the epub file they sent for approval. I don&#8217;t remember what it was called, but it must have been kind of crappy because for some reason it generated the post titles twice throughout the whole book.</span></p>
<p> When I requested a revision and explained the problem to the Vook team, they quickly got back to me and informed me that they had tested it out on all major eReader devices and did not encounter this particular issue. So I went and downloaded <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions/download.html">Adobe Digital Editions</a> and opened the file with that instead, only to find that it was in fact perfect.</span></p>
<p> Must have been the program, so I went ahead and approved it immediately and thanked them for the outstanding experience they provided. I asked to be invoiced separately for the two services, which they were more than willing to accommodate me on. </span></p>
<p> I then sent them <strong>$550</strong> via Paypal and my collection of blog posts is in the process of publishing in Amazon&#8217;s Kindle store at this very moment.</span></p>
<h2>My Blog is Reborn as an eBook</h2>
<p> I just checked on it a few minutes ago and it now has an ASIN, so it should be live soon. This should be an interesting publishing experiment, though I don&#8217;t expect it will sell many copies considering the content is available for free right here on the blog.</span></p>
<p> Which reminds me of the post I wrote not too long ago about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="How to Differentiate Public Domain Content to Sell on Amazon" href="http://#/how-to-differentiate-public-domain-content-to-sell-on-amazon/">non-copyrighted material</a></span> in the eyes of Amazon, who have clearly stated in the past that they do not accept material which is available elsewhere on the web for free.</span></p>
<p> However, in that same post I shared a link to another author who published her fiction both on Amazon and elsewhere for free. Amazon gave her a pass, but what will the verdict be for others who do the same?</span></p>
<p> I guess we&#8217;ll find out.</span></p>
<p> This is dragging on longer than I had planned, so in closing I will simply encourage those who truly enjoy reading my blog to head on over to Amazon in a few hours and grab a copy of the eBook to show their support.</span></p>
<p> I will be eternally grateful and it will help me keep this site going, which is a tremendous help. It is jam packed with the best of my content on self-publishing and book marketing and I hope you enjoy it!
